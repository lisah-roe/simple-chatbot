# simple-chatbot

A simple chatbot intended for use in schools workshops and taster sessions.

The output function is simple, and is used for both echoing the users message and printing the 'bot' message.  It should not need to be amended by participants.

There is a response function that _can_ be altered by participants for fun, the most simple and fun alterations can be made by adding to the responses array.

CSS could also be altered for a new look and feel.


Can be run in codepen (use index.html, script.js and style.css in the codepen windows ), or use the standalone versions (index-standalone.html, script-standalone.js and style.css)
